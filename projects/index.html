      <h2>The Guitars</h2>
      <article>
        <p>My longest running project involves repairing and giving away guitars 
        to kids that need music, but might not have the funds to get started.
        I will pick up just about anything in the 100-150 usd range and give it
        a go. I also tend to pass around ukes for the kiddos not quite ready for
        a big stringy thing. What I try to do is:
        <ol>
          <li>Make sure it wil hold tune and intonation.</li>
          <li>Make sure the frets are in decent shape</li>
          <li>Get an understanding of a couple chords and timing</li>
          <li>Pass a guitar, a practice amp, cables and a couple sets of
            strings</li>
          <li>Teach the basics of maintaining a guitar</li>
        </ol>
        Overall this process takes around 2-3 months, but sets them up 
        with a lifetime of music and communication skills. I also let them
        know that if they ever have any issues with the guitar to bring it by
        and we will see what we can do.
