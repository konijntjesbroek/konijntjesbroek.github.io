        <p>
          I have been using this grouping as a catchall for my random ideas
          that help me to see the world a little differently. Initially, I 
          used it to produce 1st hand research doccuments on papers I created
          in the mid-90s. Later I moved on to structuring random groupthink and
          and human thought processing experiments. About this time I started
          to get involved in the open software and linux movements.
          <p>Most of these projects are half finished, but in the process of
          building out a load of half done projects I learned a good bit about
          what works for prepping a project. I have saved that knowledge under
          the <a href="https://github.com/konijntjesbroek/templates">layout
          templates</a>. I hope you enjoy the site and if you feel like I might
          fit in with something you are working on, <a href="https://discord.gg/3eyAmufV">drop

          <h3>The Color Scheme</h3> 
          This is designed to mimic the <a 
          href="https://terminals-wiki.org/wiki/index.php/Wyse_WY-GPT">amber
          screened monitors</a> I first started learning on. The University of
          Memphis math lab gave me access to vax/vms, gopher, nexus/lexus and
          irc. It also allowed me to start playinjg with html and c. I stayed
          too long and missed my ride.

          <h3><a href="https://opendyslexic.org/">The Font</a></h3>
          I suffer from floaty word/number syndrome, especially when I get
          tired. This font decreases the number of re-reads/jumps by at least
          2-3 times over what standard sans fonts do. I cannot recommend this
          enough it you struggle with the same.

          <h3><a href="http://www.catb.org/hacker-emblem/">The Glider</a></h3>
          The glider was designated by Eric Raymond to be the universal
          identifiers for those of us driven more by curiosity than self
          preservation. It is the first self propulsive form discovered in the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game
          of Life</a> I have implemented my own version, listed on the projects
          page.
