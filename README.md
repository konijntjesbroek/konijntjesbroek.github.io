## Summary:
    === --- === --- === --- === --- === --- === --- === --- === --- === --- === ---  
    This is my personal playground. Nothing here is guaranteed to be fit for   
    anything except me fooling around with stuff I am trying to understand. My   
    current focus is building out ELB and figuring what tools I want to employ for  
    data collection and display. My current thoughts are to store most documents in  
    PDF and make them visible through the browser, but I am also looking at how to  
    convert them into better formats (mobi, epub, html) and if I want to put in the  
    effort for the conversion. 
    
    Additionally, I am looking at what sort of information I want to preserve in   
    the collection. Initially, I was of the firehose opinion; save it all and you  
    can filter out what you don't need. While this works for a stacks segment, I   
    want a 'critical use' library. I want to know that the information is practical  
    and applicable when it is needed. So possibly doing a small curated collection  
    of useful stuff with a larger all mankind's thoughts on stuff for rainy day   
    exploration.
