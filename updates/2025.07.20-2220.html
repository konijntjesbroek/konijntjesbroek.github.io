        <h2>HBC: Design</h2>
        <p>
          Working to make this page more useful to myself and the way I am
          leaning right now is to store active projects and progress on here.
          What have I done recently, what are the next steps, what are the
          obstacles I am coming up against in moving to the next step. For the
          HBC site, my main issue is one of understanding/focus. I have been
          focusing on it being 'me' on the web, but, that isn't really what I
          want. I am not interesting, most of the time I sit around listening to
          random music or watching NCIS or Castle reruns. I study some, support
          causes I think are good ideas and blow through way too much money on
          takeout.
        </p>
        <p>
          The projects, however, some of those are peachy keen and deserve to
          have folks looking at and expanding on them. So I am going to be
          putting the primary focus on the updates in the main page, the  last
          week or so of them with the archives accessible within the projects
          section.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also working on prioritizing the projects on which ones will give
          me the most enjoyment/gains. They way I am leaning right now is:
          <ol>
            <li>HBC first</li>
            <li>LPIC-1</li>
            <li>Dinae tailpiece rebuild</li>
            <li>ELB Design</li>
            <li>LPIC-2</li>
          </ol>
