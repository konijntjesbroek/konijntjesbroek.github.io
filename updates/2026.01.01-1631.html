          As a way of connecting with my mother, I am diving back into to art
          she wanted me to pursue that more fully when I was younger, but I 
          mostly blew it off witn younger man's concerns. Money, stuff, the 
          usual. I have dabbled with artwork over the intervening years, but 
          never really set about to learn the deeper side of formal study of
          forms and manipulation since I was in high school. I have bought a
          lot of books on the subject but never make it past the first few
          pages. Recently, while watching some autodidactic videos on YouTube,
          I came across the the following quote, which really resonated with me.
          <blockquote>
            The true learner obsesses over the process, they want to
            learn every aspect that will allow them to succeed. 
          </blockquote>
          This made me reconsider what I have doing.

          Historically, I pick things up pretty easy, and if I don't I move on.
          While I have been able to skate by on this methodology for a large
          portion of my life, it has hindered me in ways I had't realized or
          more accurately in ways I didn't want to admit. I just preferred to
          think of myself has having a broad understanding that allowed me to
          join into multiple conversations, and because of my quick wit and
          solid research acumen, I could know more, quicker than about 80-90% of
          the population when I needed to. I don't want to just be better than
          most folks with surface knowledge any more. I want to understand and
          be able to relay that knowledge effectively to others. To pursue this
          I have identified a few key regions I want formally study:
         </p>
         <p>
          <ol>
            <li>Pen and Ink Sketching/Drawing</li>
            <li>Watercolor Painting</li>
            <li>Penmanship/Calligraphy</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
        for now I am pushing this to <a href='https://www.instagram.com/konijntjesbroek/'>
        instagram</a> to get get some digital presence until I get some work
        that I feel is decent. I will then start figuring out a place to make
        prints available at a reasonable price. Pricing on originals will be
        according to the time I put in at a rate of 50-100/hour + materials.
