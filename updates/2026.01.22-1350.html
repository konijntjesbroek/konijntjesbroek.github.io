      <h2>Digging in on Myself</h2>

        <p>
          I am working on updating 2 things this week, The primary one is by
          far the more difficult for me. I am trying to make sure that I have an
          accurate depiction of my skills for a curriculum vitae. Not just a
          standard resume, but a listing of what I am working on and what I want
          to pursue in the future. There are a lot of things I excel at that
          don't really fit onto the standard app.
          Secondly, I am adding new books to the book log. I need to add the
          book report for the finished ones still. Just running out of time in
          the week. Still streamlining the Organization System, but that is
          eating up about 6-10 hours a week, outside of the 30-60m/day for
          morning and evening rituals.
          I will get it figured out, just need to keep refining it. Another
          conflict I am working on is keeping up social energy. I get a lot of
          value/meaning from frequent interractions with my friends and family.
          This has become more evident over the last few months, but fitting it
          in with the increasing project and existing work load has been
          overwhelming. I gotta work or prioritizing so that I don't see huge
          gaps in any of the areas, and continue solid growth.
