      <h2>Big Realizations and a Couple of Steps Back</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
        Overall, I have been focusing getting more consistent in my drawing and
        daily planning and tracking. It is a struggle and realizing that I am
        doing about 3 times the work to make sure I am progressing toward my
        long term goals was pretty frustrating. I am trying to build the system,
        do the work toward my goals, and log the process. I have been feeling 
        like a failure because I am only hitting about 75% of my daily tasks.
        After a couple of weekly reviews, I figured out that it was my old
        friend concrete thinking that was dragging me down. I was forcing myself
        to do everything on every task despite being in the preliminary stages
        of growing into the person I want to be.

        My takeaway from this weeks review was to classify activities as core
        and peripheral activities. Current job duties: core, making time for
        setting up and closing down the day: core, mastering the yoyo:
        peripheral. Understanding the things that are mandatory in a day enables
        me to be more understanding of myself and prioritize the daily tasks.

        <h3>Busted Links</h3>
        <p>
        I went through and remapped the broken links, I also fixed the ordering
        of the nav links at the top. I want to have them in order of importance.
        They may be shifting again a few more times as we work through stuff.

        <h3>Booklog</h3>
        <p>
        Added the current books I am reading and cleaned up the sub-page for the
        1st book I completed this year. Goal is to put in notes and summaries
        for most books I read. Tentative areas are Summary, Themes, Quotes,
        Notes.
