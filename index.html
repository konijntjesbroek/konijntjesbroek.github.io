        <details><summary>2026.01.22: Digging in on Myself</summary>
        <p>
          I am working on updating 2 things this week, The primary one is by
          far the more difficult for me. I am trying to make sure that I have an
          accurate depiction of my skills for a curriculum vitae. Not just a
          standard resume, but a listing of what I am working on and what I want
          to pursue in the future. There are a lot of things I excel at that
          don't really fit onto the standard app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, I am adding new books to the book log. I need to add the
          book report for the finished ones still. Just running out of time in
          the week. Still streamlining the Organization System, but that is
          eating up about 6-10 hours a week, outside of the 30-60m/day for
          morning and evening rituals.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will get it figured out, just need to keep refining it. Another
          conflict I am working on is keeping up social energy. I get a lot of
          value/meaning from frequent interractions with my friends and family.
          This has become more evident over the last few months, but fitting it
          in with the increasing project and existing work load has been
          overwhelming. I gotta work or prioritizing so that I don't see huge
          gaps in any of the areas, and continue solid growth.

        <summary>2026.01.17: Big Realizations and a Couple of Steps Back</summary>
        <p>
        Overall, I have been focusing getting more consistent in my drawing and
        daily planning and tracking. It is a struggle and realizing that I am
        doing about 3 times the work to make sure I am progressing toward my
        long term goals was pretty frustrating. I am trying to build the system,
        do the work toward my goals, and log the process. I have been feeling 
        like a failure because I am only hitting about 75% of my daily tasks.
        After a couple of weekly reviews, I figured out that it was my old
        friend concrete thinking that was dragging me down. I was forcing myself
        to do everything on every task despite being in the preliminary stages
        of growing into the person I want to be. 
        </p>
        <p>
        My takeaway from this weeks review was to classify activities as core
        and peripheral activities. Current job duties: core, making time for
        setting up and closing down the day: core, mastering the yoyo:
        peripheral. Understanding the things that are mandatory in a day enables
        me to be more understanding of myself and prioritize the daily tasks.

      <h3>Main Page</h3>
      <em>Busted Links--</em> 
        I went through and remapped the broken links, I also fixed the ordering
        of the nav links at the top. I want to have them in order of importance.
        They may be shifting again a few more times as we work through stuff.
        
        <em>Weekly Update--</em>
        Late this week, but in there mostly before Sunday.
        <h3>The stacks</h3>
        <em>Booklog--</em>
        Added the current books I am reading and cleaned up the sub-page for the
        1st book I completed this year. Goal is to put in notes and summaries
        for most books I read. Tentative areas are Summary, Themes, Quotes,
        Notes.</br></br>

      <article><details><summary>2026.01.01: Unnamed Studio Project</summary>
        <p>
          As a way of connecting with my mother, I am diving back into to art
          she wanted me to pursue that more fully when I was younger, but I 
          mostly blew it off witn younger man's concerns. Money, stuff, the 
          usual. I have dabbled with artwork over the intervening years, but 
          never really set about to learn the deeper side of formal study of
          forms and manipulation since I was in high school. I have bought a
          lot of books on the subject but never make it past the first few
          pages. Recently, while watching some autodidactic videos on YouTube,
          I came across the the following quote, which really resonated with me.
          <blockquote>
            The true learner obsesses over the process, they want to
            learn every aspect that will allow them to succeed. 
          </blockquote>
          This made me reconsider what I have doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Historically, I pick things up pretty easy, and if I don't I move on.
          While I have been able to skate by on this methodology for a large
          portion of my life, it has hindered me in ways I had't realized or
          more accurately in ways I didn't want to admit. I just preferred to
          think of myself has having a broad understanding that allowed me to
          join into multiple conversations, and because of my quick wit and
          solid research acumen, I could know more, quicker than about 80-90% of
          the population when I needed to. I don't want to just be better than
          most folks with surface knowledge any more. I want to understand and
          be able to relay that knowledge effectively to others. To pursue this
          I have identified a few key regions I want formally study:
         </p>
         <p>
          <ol>
            <li>Pen and Ink Sketching/Drawing</li>
            <li>Watercolor Painting</li>
            <li>Penmanship/Calligraphy</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
        for now I am pushing this to <a href='https://www.instagram.com/konijntjesbroek/'>
        instagram</a> to get get some digital presence until I get some work
        that I feel is decent. I will then start figuring out a place to make
        prints available at a reasonable price. Pricing on originals will be
        according to the time I put in at a rate of 50-100/hour + materials.

      <article><details><summary>2025.07.23: Flashcards</summary>
        <p>I stared a new project to day to assist with the LPIC test prep (or
        you might say to avoid LPIC test prep). The general purpose is to allow
        you to create Prompts and Responses, with optional objective and
        weighting. This will allow me to measure my understanding of each
        objective and progress toward completing the objectives for the quia
        wiht more confidence.
        </p>
        <p>The primary goals right now sit at manipulating text to be displayed
        in a reasonable formate (using asciimatics lib). Then create the objects
        for the cards and decks.

        <summary>2025.07.20: HBC: Design</summary>
        <p>
          Working to make this page more useful to myself and the way I am
          leaning right now is to store active projects and progress on here.
          What have I done recently, what are the next steps, what are the
          obstacles I am coming up against in moving to the next step. For the
          HBC site, my main issue is one of understanding/focus. I have been
          focusing on it being 'me' on the web, but, that isn't really what I
          want. I am not interesting, most of the time I sit around listening to
          random music or watching NCIS or Castle reruns. I study some, support
          causes I think are good ideas and blow through way too much money on
          takeout.
        </p>
        <p>
          The projects, however, some of those are peachy keen and deserve to
          have folks looking at and expanding on them. So I am going to be
          putting the primary focus on the updates in the main page, the  last
          week or so of them with the archives accessible within the projects
          section.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also working on prioritizing the projects on which ones will give
          me the most enjoyment/gains. They way I am leaning right now is:
          <ol>
            <li>HBC first</li>
            <li>LPIC-1</li>
            <li>Dinae tailpiece rebuild</li>
            <li>ELB Design</li>
            <li>LPIC-2</li>
          </ol>
