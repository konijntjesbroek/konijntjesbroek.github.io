      <h2>Welcome to the Arlonian Institute of Useless Information</h2>
      <article>
        <p>I have been using this grouping as a catchall for my random ideas
        that help me to see the world a little differently. Initially, I 
        used it to produce 1st hand research doccuments on papers I created
        in the mid-90s. Later I moved on to structuring random groupthink and
        and human thought processing experiments. About this time I started
        to get involved in the open software and linux movements.
        </p>
        <p>Most of these projects are half finished, but in the process of
        building out a load of half done projects I learned a good bit about
        what works for prepping a project. I have saved that knowledge under
        the <a href="https://github.com/konijntjesbroek/templates">layout
        templates</a>. I hope you enjoy the site and if you feel like I might
        fit in with something you are working on, <a href=:https://discord.gg/3eyAmufV">drop
        me a line</a>
