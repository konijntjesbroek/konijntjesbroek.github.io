        <p>I stared a new project to day to assist with the LPIC test prep (or
        you might say to avoid LPIC test prep). The general purpose is to allow
        you to create Prompts and Responses, with optional objective and
        weighting. This will allow me to measure my understanding of each
        objective and progress toward completing the objectives for the quia
        wiht more confidence.
        </p>
        <p>The primary goals right now sit at manipulating text to be displayed
        in a reasonable formate (using asciimatics lib). Then create the objects
        for the cards and decks.

        <summary>2025.07.20: HBC: Design</summary>
        <p>
          Working to make this page more useful to myself and the way I am
          leaning right now is to store active projects and progress on here.
          What have I done recently, what are the next steps, what are the
          obstacles I am coming up against in moving to the next step. For the
          HBC site, my main issue is one of understanding/focus. I have been
          focusing on it being 'me' on the web, but, that isn't really what I
          want. I am not interesting, most of the time I sit around listening to
          random music or watching NCIS or Castle reruns. I study some, support
          causes I think are good ideas and blow through way too much money on
          takeout.
        </p>
        <p>
          The projects, however, some of those are peachy keen and deserve to
          have folks looking at and expanding on them. So I am going to be
          putting the primary focus on the updates in the main page, the  last
          week or so of them with the archives accessible within the projects
          section.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also working on prioritizing the projects on which ones will give
          me the most enjoyment/gains. They way I am leaning right now is:
          <ol>
            <li>HBC first</li>
            <li>LPIC-1</li>
            <li>Dinae tailpiece rebuild</li>
            <li>ELB Design</li>
            <li>LPIC-2</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
