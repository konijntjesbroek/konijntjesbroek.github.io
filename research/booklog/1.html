        <h3>Summary:</h3>
          <blockquote>
          <p>
          Four children are sent to the country to live with a professor during
          the bombing of London in WWII. While playing a round the peculiarly
          unique grounds, Lucy, the youngest, stumbles onto a fantastic
          befriends a faun who tells her of the white witch, her curse on Narnia
          that cause an endless winter with no Christmas. After returning
          through the wardrobe to find no time had passed, Lucy's siblings,
          especially Edmund accuse her of telling falsehoods.
          </p>
          <p>
          After checking the wardrobe repeatedly, eventually Lucy finds her way
          back to Narnia, and this time Edmund follows. While Lucy is having a
          tea with Tumnus, Edmund meets the Queen of Narnia and gorges on 
          Turkish Delight. He also vows to return, bringing his siblings with
          him. On returning from Narnia, Edmund tells the others they were only
          playing make believe. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Concerned by the story spinning from Lucy, Peter and Susan go to the
          professor for guidance. He asks which is more believable, Lucy is 
          relentlessly asserting that she is visiting a far off land in the face
          of obviously no time passing, when historically she has been honest
          and loyal, or that it is actually happening?
          </p>
          <p>
          A while later all four children are caught off guard when the stern
          Mrs. McCready is giving a tour of the manor and they seek shelter in
          the wardrobe. They find themselves in a bleak Narnia instead. Tumnus
          has been taken by the White Witch's police chief Fenrir Ulf. The
          children are guided by a robin to Mr. Beaver who takes them to his dam
          and feeds them. He then tells them of Aslan's return and the fate of
          poor Mr. Tumnus. During the telling, Edmund sneaks off to the Queen
          and the remaining party makes a hasty retreat toward the stone table.
          </p>
          <p>
          The next morning, the Beavers and the children are visited by Father
          Christmas and given gifts. Peter: Sword and Shield; Lucy: A healing
          tonic; Susan: a bow and quiver which cannot miss. Throughout the day,
          the winter fades and spring blooms. This slows the White Witch's
          progress. Edmund realizes the error of his way. The other children are able to reach the stone table. 
          </p>
          <p>
          The White Whitch claims Edmund for his treachery and that he must be 
          killed on the stone table according to the old magic. Aslan offers
          himself as a sacrifice in Edmund's place, and moves the gathering army
          to safety coaching Peter in tactics along the way. After camp is set
          up, Aslan sets off, lonely and sad to his death. Lucy and Susan
          follow, not knowing he is dying for Edmund. They are told to wait a 
          ways off and witness the cowardice and creulty of the witch's army but
          hold back as Aslan asked. After Aslan is bound, shorn and slaughtered,
          her army sets out to Aslan's Army's encampment.
          </p>
          <p>
          The girls unmuzzle Aslan and mice come to chew his bindings off. As
          the girls sit mourning throughout the night they barely notice the 
          other is there. As the sun is rising, the stone table splits and Aslan
          appears. He explains the deeper magic from before time began. They set
          off to the witch's home and reanimate the creatures that she had 
          turned to stone. The party then joins the remaining army and Aslan
          defeats the witch.
          </p>
          <p>
          The children rule Narnia for many years and decide to chase a white
          stag that is said to grant a wish if caught. They track it to the long
          forgotten wood that leads to the wardrobe, to find no time has passed.
